6. about (Short Description / Summary): 
This project describes a method of implementing two factor authentication using mobile phones. The proposed method guarantees that authenticating to services, such as online banking or ATM machines, is done in a very secure manner. The proposed system involves using a mobile phone as a software token for One Time Password generation. The generated One Time Password is valid for only a short user defined period of time and is generated by factors that are unique to both, the user and the mobile device itself. Additionally, an SMS-based mechanism is implemented as both a backup mechanism for retrieving the password and as a possible mean of synchronization. The proposed method has been implemented and tested. Initial results show the success of the proposed method.

7. Install (Installation procedure): Step by step procedure to install software.
?In this project all employee needs to enter username password and auto generated number from admin to log in.
?If anybody wants to use a computer of another employee then also without that employee permission with the help of mobile message nobody can access that machine.
